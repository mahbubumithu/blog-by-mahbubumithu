## Getting Started

To create a **GitHub Profile**, follow these steps:

- Create a new repository with the exact same name as your __GitHub username__ (e.g., if your username is __mahbubumithu__, your repository should be called __mahbubumithu__).
- Add a README.md file to this repository. This file is where you’ll write your profile in **Markdown**.
- Customize your README.md file with the information you’d like to display.

Your profile README will appear on your **GitHub Profile** page, giving visitors a quick summary of your skills, projects, and more!

```
__Example__:

```markdown
## Hi there, I'm MD. MAHBUB UDDIN! 👋 from Bangladesh.

```
__Output__:
## Hi there, I'm MD. MAHBUB UDDIN! 👋 from Bangladesh.

- **Frameworks**: React, Django
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, VSCode

```

```

__Output__:

4. Displaying GitHub Stats

GitHub offers customizable profile stats that you can embed in your README. Use the following example to add your stats.

```markdown
## My GitHub Stats

![Your Name's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=YourGitHubUsername&show_icons=true&theme=radical)
```
Replace __YourGitHubUsername__ with your GitHub username to start tracking your stats.

__Example__:

```markdown
## My GitHub Stats

![MD. Mahbub Uddin's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mahbubumithu&show_icons=true&theme=radical)
```
__Output__:
## My GitHub Stats

![MD. Mahbub Uddin's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mahbubumithu&show_icons=true&theme=radical)

---

5. __Highlighting Top Projects__

Link directly to your top projects, so visitors can easily find your best work.

```markdown
## Featured Projects

- [Project 1](https://github.com/YourUsername/Project1): Brief description of the project.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/YourUsername/Project2): Another project description.
```

__Output__:

Visitor badges show how many people have visited your profile. Here’s an example:

```markdown
![Visitor Count](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=YourGitHubUsername.YourGitHubUsername)

```
Replace __YourGitHubUsername__ with your GitHub username to start tracking views.

__Example__:

```markdown
![Visitor Count](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=mahbubumithu.mahbubumithu)

```
__Output__:

![Visitor Count](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=mahbubumithu.mahbubumithu)

> I specially recommend this visitor count at the top of the page.

```markdown
## Connect with Me

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/YourLinkedInProfile)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YourTwitterHandle)
- [Website](https://yourwebsite.com)

```
